- Weather CLI App:

  - Objective: Create a command-line tool that fetches weather information from an API.
  - Requirements: Parse JSON data from an API, handle network requests, and display formatted weather data based on user input (e.g., city).

- Simple File Encryptor/Decryptor:

  - Objective: Develop a tool that can encrypt and decrypt files using a simple cipher like Caesar cipher.
  - Requirements: Implement file I/O operations, user input for keys, and basic encryption/decryption algorithms.

- Markdown to HTML Converter:

  - Objective: Build a tool that converts Markdown text to HTML.
  - Requirements: Parse Markdown syntax and convert it into corresponding HTML. Support at least headers, paragraphs, links, and bold/italic text.

### Intermediate Level

- Multi-threaded Web Server:

  - Objective: Build a simple multi-threaded web server that can handle multiple requests simultaneously.
  - Requirements: Use threads to handle more than one connection at a time. Serve static text or files.

- Command Line Tool for File Operations:

  - Objective: Create a CLI tool that can perform operations like copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files.
  - Requirements: Include detailed logging of operations and error handling for access rights, missing files, etc.

- Text-based Adventure Game:

  - Objective: Develop a text-based adventure game with multiple locations, items, and puzzle elements.
  - Requirements: Implement state management for game progress, and include commands that players can use to move between locations, pick up items, and solve puzzles.

- REST API Client:

  - Objective: Develop a client application that interacts with a REST API to perform CRUD operations.
  - Requirements: Handle HTTP methods, parse JSON payloads, and manage error handling with proper feedback to the user.

- Static Site Generator:

  - Objective: Create a simple static site generator that takes Markdown files and generates a website.
  - Requirements: Read and convert multiple Markdown files, generate a navigation menu, and produce output HTML files.

  - Objective: Create a real-time chat application using WebSocket for communication.
  - Requirements: Support multiple users, handle connections, disconnections, and maintain user sessions.

- Concurrent Data Processing System:

  - Objective: Build a system that can process data from multiple sources concurrently and perform aggregations or transformations.
  - Requirements: Use advanced concurrency patterns and synchronization techniques to ensure data integrity and performance.

- Distributed File System:

  - Objective: Implement a simple version of a distributed file system where files can be stored across multiple network nodes.
  - Requirements: Handle networking, data partitioning, and replication across multiple nodes for fault tolerance.

- Machine Learning Library:

  - Objective: Develop a basic machine learning library that can perform linear regression and k-means clustering.
  - Requirements: Implement algorithms for linear regression and k-means, handle data input and normalization, and provide user interfaces for training and predictions.

- Custom Memory Allocator:

  - Objective: Write a custom memory allocator for Rust that can be used for efficient memory management in specific scenarios.
  - Requirements: Understand and apply memory allocation techniques, integrate with Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, and test for performance and correctness.
